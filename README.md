# Roblox-Services-Docs

Hio, my name is CloneTrooper0130, known to some people as Mario. I've been involved within the roblox community for more than 5 years and been there for witnessing kinda stuff. 
In this doc I'll be briefly explaining roblox's MAIN services, how one can benefit from them (with regards to game development) and how I personally perceive them.
Please bear in mind that this is unofficial. Hopefully it'll eventually get noticed by some roblox director and will be on the official wiki. (Because all wikis need a tweak of playfulness)
